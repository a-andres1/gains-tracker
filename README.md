# gains-tracker

## Description
For this project we were tasked with creating a mongo db app that would store data for workouts.  

Here it is working locally, though it will not work on Heroku.

### Futher Developement
I would like to move my routes to my route folder if I had the chance to come back and work on this.   
    
## Technologies Used
- Heroku
- Mongo DB
- Mongoose
- Javascript

## Install
You'll need to download the repo and run npm i to install. Then you can run npm run seed to seed the database. Npm start will start the server and it's up and running. Or of course you could navigate to the Heroku app. Whatever works for you.
